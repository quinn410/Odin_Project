    <h1>My Learning path</h1>
    <h2> About Me</h2>
<p> my name is Quinn Fortin and I'm an
 <strong>aspiring</strong> software developer!
I began this Journey in the Summer of 2021, by attending an online class 
Titled <b>Learning How to Learn</b>
with <b> <i><abbr title-"Professor">Prof.</abbr> Barbara Oakley.</i> </b>
Its a free online course offered by UCSD via Coursera. I am actively using many of the valuable tips and skills that
 I gained from that 4 week experience, such as how to chunk, retain and recall information, All keys I'll need 
to be successful through the next leg of my journey. I am even employing the
<dfn><i>Pomodoro Technique</i></dfn>
to maximize my time management and productivity. </p>
<p>I am currently well into the next leg of my journey that I started on 
November 15<sup>th</sup> 
2021<sub>1</sub>. 
This leg consists of learning and applying 

as I go through 
<cite> HTML & CSS</cite> and
 <cite>Javascript & Jquery</cite>. 
Both of these books are written by 
<b> <i> Jon Duckett</i> </b>.

	<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<p>  I'm glad you're here! Feel free to stay awhile and 
<i>poke around</i>!
 There's a lot to do, so dig in!
At first , I'll be chronicling this adventure as a 
<em><b><i>*mostly*</i></b></em>
<b>self taught</b> developer. 
And as I grow and progress, Ill then use this site to show
case projects and possibly link other webpages that I build as well.
